# Analysis_On_US_Pollution_Data

**Air pollution is one of the outstanding environmental concerns in the world today, affecting both developed and developing regions. In 2016 alone, it accounted for 4.2 million deaths globally and over 59,000 in the U.S, because of its association with stroke, lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, acute lower respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
In this project, we will perform data analysis on a dataset documented by the U.S. EPA on pollution caused by four major pollutants. The four pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone(O3).** 

**Insights:**

•	Four key performance indicators (KPIs) have been incorporated, namely Co Mean, So2 Mean, No2 Mean, and O3 Mean.

•	The pollution trend over the years: 
  With the exception of Ozone, which continues to fluctuate, the trend for all pollutants is decreasing, indicating an improvement in air quality in the United States.

•	The city with elevated levels of Carbon Monoxide:
  is depicted through a Bar Chart. Salt Lake City ranks first, followed by Los Angeles and Rubidoux in second and third place, respectively.

•	Monthly trend of O3 AQI levels:
  The line graph illustrates the monthly variation in O3 AQI levels, providing insight into the peak months for O3 AQI. It is evident from the chart that O3 AQI levels steadily rise from January, reaching a 
  peak in July, before gradually declining from September and hitting a low point in December.
  
•	Average of No2 AQI based on county:
  The Horizontal bar graph illustrates the top 10 counties based on the average rate of NO2 AQI. Denver County holds the first position, followed by Maricopa in second place, while Riverside County ranks last 
  among the top 10 counties.

•	State with Rate of all 4 Pollutants:
  We utilized a map to display the distribution of pollutants across different states. Darker colours indicate a higher concentration of pollutants, while lighter colours signify lower levels of pollutants. 
  According to the chart, Hawaii ranks highest for having the least number of pollutants, whereas Colorado ranks highest for having the highest pollutant levels among states.
