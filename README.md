# Analysis_On_US_Pollution_Data(2019-2023)

In this project, we will perform data analysis on a dataset documented by the U.S. EPA on pollution caused by four major pollutants. The four pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone(O3).

**Insights:**

•	The pollution trend over the years: With the exception of Ozone, which continues to fluctuate in 2019 with average rate of AQI 37.57 to 42.72 in 2023, the trend for all pollutants is decreasing, that nitrogen dioxide average of 18.39 to1 6.97 from 2019 to 2023, carbon monoxide 3.84 to3.42 average Co AQI and sulphur dioxide 1.02 to 0.59 average AQI indicating an improvement in air quality in the United States.

•	The city with elevated levels of Carbon Monoxide is depicted through a Bar Chart. Phoenix ranks first with high level of Co AQI with Average rate of 6.37, followed by Los Angeles and Rubidoux in second and third place with rate of 5.97 and 5.2, respectively.

•	Monthly trend of O3 AQI levels: The line graph illustrates the monthly variation in O3 AQI levels, providing insight into the peak months for O3 AQI. It is evident from the chart that O3 AQI levels steadily rise rate of 26.89 from January, reaching a peak in July with 48.77 rate, before gradually declining from September and hitting a low point in December with rate of 24.46.

•	Average of No2 AQI based on county: The Horizontal bar graph illustrates the top 10 counties based on the average rate of NO2 AQI. Denver County holds the first position with average rate of 29.36, followed by Maricopa in second place with 28.89, while Riverside County ranks last among the top 10 counties with 24.61 of low No2 AQI.

•	State with Rate of all 4 Pollutants: We utilized a map to display the distribution of pollutants across different states. Darker colours indicate a higher concentration of pollutants, while lighter colours signify lower levels of pollutants. According to the chart, Hawaii ranks highest for having the least number of pollutants with a average rate of 36.37, whereas Colorado ranks highest for having the highest pollutant levels among states with 79.81 rate.
